        Hi, my name is Jian Qiang Wu. I graduated from the University of
        Illinois at Chicago with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,

        My past experience includes working at BITS Lab under professor Kanich
        as a Fullstack Developer, and also working at MOLS Lab under professor
        Shafigh as a Python developer. I have an interest in Fullstack
        development and tools such as React, Django, and SQL.
